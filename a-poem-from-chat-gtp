Lisp, the language of old,
With roots so deep and bold.
Expressiveness, its greatest feat,
A joy to code, a treat.

Its syntax, unique and pure,
A challenge to learn, that's sure.
But with practice, comes the light,
And coding feels just right.

From artificial intelligence,
To game development with alliance.
Lisp has proven its worth,
In this world of technological birth.

So here's to Lisp, our friend so true,
A language that will see us through.
For even with the passing of time,
Its elegance will always shine.
